## Microbial Ecology & Evolution
My main research interest is the understanding of **eco-evolutionary principles** governing microbial communities: primary evolutionary and ecologic forces shaping **populations** and their **metabolic potential**, their **interactions** with other microbial species, their **hosts**, and the **environment**, and the role of **stochasticity**.

## Microbiome Analysis
In the pursuit of these questions, I’ve garnered ample experience on **genomic** and **metagenomic** analyses in **environmental**, **clinical**, **agricultural**, and **engineered settings**, including the description, characterization, modeling, and simulation of microbial communities and populations. I’ve explored and discussed both theoretical and practical problems on microbiome analysis including the development and application of methods on **phylogenomics**, **taxonomy** of prokaryotes, **metabolic modeling**, **statistical techniques**, and **sequence analyses**.

## Scientific Production
I’ve authored **over three dozen papers and book chapters** (about a third as first author) with **over a thousand citations** and an **h-index of 19**, presented multiple **workshops**, **seminars**, and **symposia** on microbiome analysis for researchers and undergraduate educators, and served as **reviewer** for several international journals. [See my list of publications](/publications/).

## Software Development
New ideas need implementation, and throughout my research I’ve made it a point to implement those ideas in **efficient**, **high-quality**, **well-documented**, and **user-friendly software**. I’ve developed tens of **bioinformatic tools** and **web interfaces** in a variety of programming languages and frameworks (**Ruby**, **Rails**, **Perl**, **R**, **C++**, etc) with over 6,000 downloads or online queries per month. [See my software contributions](/software/).
