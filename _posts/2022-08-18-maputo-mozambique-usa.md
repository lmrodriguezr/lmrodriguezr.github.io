The infant gut microbiome has lifelong implications on health and immunity but
there is still limited understanding of the microbiome differences and
similarities between children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) vs.
high-income countries (HICs). Here, we describe and compare the microbiome
profile of children aged under 48 months in two urban areas: Maputo, Mozambique
and Atlanta, USA using shotgun metagenomics. The gut microbiome of American
children showed distinct development, characterized by higher alpha diversity
after infancy, compared to the same age group of African children, and the
microbiomes clustered separately based on geographic location or age. The
abundances of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs)
were significantly higher in Maputo children, driven primarily by several
primary and opportunistic pathogens. Most notably, about 50% of Maputo children
under the age of two were positive for enterotoxigenic (ETEC) and typical
enteropathogenic (EPEC) _Escherichia coli_ diagnostic genes while none of the
Atlanta age-matched children showed such a positive signal. In contrast,
commensal species such as _Phocaeicola vulgatus_ and _Bacteroides caccae_ were
more abundant in Atlanta, potentially reflecting diets rich in animal protein
and susceptibility to inflammatory diseases. Overall, our results suggest that
the different environments characterizing the two cities have significant,
distinctive signatures on the microbiota of children and its development over
time. Lack of safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions and/or
unsafe food sources may explain the higher enteric pathogen load among children
in Maputo.
