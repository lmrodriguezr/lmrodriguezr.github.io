Thousands of new bacterial and archaeal species and higher-level taxa are
discovered each year through the analysis of genomes and metagenomes. The
Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) provides hierarchical sequence-based
descriptions and classifications for new and as-yet-unnamed taxa. However,
bacterial nomenclature, as currently configured, cannot keep up with the need
for new well-formed names. Instead, microbiologists have been forced to use
hard-to-remember alphanumeric placeholder labels. Here, we exploit an approach
to the generation of well-formed arbitrary Latinate names at a scale sufficient
to name tens of thousands of unnamed taxa within GTDB. These newly created names
represent an important resource for the microbiology community, facilitating
communication between bioinformaticians, microbiologists and taxonomists, while
populating the emerging landscape of microbial taxonomic and functional
discovery with accessible and memorable linguistic labels.
