Over the last fifteen years, genomics has become fully integrated into
prokaryotic systematics. The genomes of most type strains have been sequenced,
genome sequence similarity is widely used for delineation of species, and
phylogenomic methods are commonly used for classification of higher taxonomic
ranks. Additionally, environmental genomics has revealed a vast diversity of
as-yet-uncultivated taxa.
In response to these developments, a new code of nomenclature, the
_Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes Described from Sequence Data_ (SeqCode),
has been developed over the last two years to allow naming of Archaea and
Bacteria using DNA sequences as the nomenclatural types. The SeqCode also allows
naming of cultured organisms, including fastidious prokaryotes that cannot be
deposited into culture collections. Several simplifications relative to the
_International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes_ (ICNP) are implemented to
make nomenclature more accessible, easier to apply and more readily
communicated. By simplifying nomenclature with the goal of a unified
classification, inclusive of both cultured and uncultured taxa, the SeqCode
will facilitate the naming of taxa in every biome on Earth, encourage the
isolation and characterization of as-yet-uncultivated taxa, and promote
synergies between the ecological, environmental, physiological, biochemical,
and molecular biological disciplines to more fully describe prokaryotes.
