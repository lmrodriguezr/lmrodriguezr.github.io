Most prokaryotes are not available as pure cultures and therefore ineligible
for naming under the rules and recommendations of the International Code of
Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP). Here we summarize the development of the
SeqCode, a code of nomenclature under which genome sequences serve as
nomenclatural types. This code enables valid publication of names of prokaryotes
based upon isolate genome, metagenome-assembled genome or single-amplified
genome sequences. Otherwise, it is similar to the ICNP with regard to the
formation of names and rules of priority. It operates through the SeqCode
Registry (https://seqco.de/), a registration portal through which names and
nomenclatural types are registered, validated and linked to metadata. We
describe the two paths currently available within SeqCode to register and
validate names, including _Candidatus_ names, and provide examples for both.
Recommendations on minimal standards for DNA sequences are provided. Thus, the
SeqCode provides a reproducible and objective framework for the nomenclature of
all prokaryotes regardless of cultivability and facilitates communication across
microbiological disciplines.
