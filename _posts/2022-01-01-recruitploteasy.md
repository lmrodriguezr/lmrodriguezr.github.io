RecruitPlotEasy is a fully automated, user-friendly pipeline for these purposes
that integrates statistical approaches to quantify intra-population sequence and
gene-content diversity and identify co-occurring relative populations in the
sample.

RecruitPlotEasy is a standalone application inspired by the Recruitment Plot v2
tools from the [Enveomics Collection](/software/enveomics).
