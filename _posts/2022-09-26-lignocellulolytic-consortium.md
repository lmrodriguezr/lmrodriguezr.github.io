The understanding and manipulation of microbial communities toward the
conversion of lignocellulose and plastics are topics of interest in microbial
ecology and biotechnology. In this study, the polymer-degrading capability of a
minimal lignocellulolytic microbial consortium (MELMC) was explored by
genome-resolved metagenomics. The MELMC was mostly composed (>90%) of three
bacterial members (_Pseudomonas protegens_;
_Pristimantibacillus lignocellulolyticus_ gen. nov., sp. nov; and
_Ochrobactrum gambitense_ sp. nov) recognized by their high-quality
metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Functional annotation of these MAGs
revealed that _Pr. lignocellulolyticus_ could be involved in cellulose and
xylan deconstruction, whereas _Ps. protegens_ could catabolize lignin-derived
chemical compounds. The capacity of the MELMC to transform synthetic plastics
was assessed by two strategies: (i) annotation of MAGs against databases
containing plastic-transforming enzymes; and (ii) predicting enzymatic activity
based on chemical structural similarities between lignin- and plastics-derived
chemical compounds, using Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System and
Tanimoto coefficients. Enzymes involved in the depolymerization of polyurethane
and polybutylene adipate terephthalate were found to be encoded by
_Ps. protegens_, which could catabolize phthalates and terephthalic acid. The
axenic culture of _Ps. protegens_ grew on polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)
nanoparticles and might be a suitable species for the industrial production of
PHAs in the context of lignin and plastic upcycling.
