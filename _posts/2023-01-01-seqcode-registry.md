The SeqCode Registry is a portal for the registration, tracking, curation, and
validation of prokaryotic names on the basis of genome sequences. It features
several automated checks, including nomenclatural and genomic reviews, as well
as a multi-scheme taxonomic browser.

The SeqCode Registry can be accessed at https://seqco.de/ and it's part of
[The SeqCode Initiative](https://seqco.de/initiative).
