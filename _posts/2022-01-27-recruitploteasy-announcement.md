Mapping of short metagenomic (or metatranscriptomic) read data to reference
isolate or single-cell genomes or metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to assess
microbial population relative abundance and/or structure represents an essential
task of many studies across environmental and clinical settings. The filtering
for the quality of the read match and assessment of read mapping results are
frequently performed without visual aids or with the assistance of
visualizations produced through ad-hoc, in-house approaches. Here, we introduce
RecruitPlotEasy, a fully automated, user-friendly pipeline for these purposes
that integrates statistical approaches to quantify intra-population sequence and
gene-content diversity and identify co-occurring relative populations in the
sample. Hence, RecruitPlotEasy should also greatly facilitate population
genetics studies.

RecruitPlotEasy is implemented in Python and R languages and is freely available
open source software under the Artistic License 2.0 from
