A debate on the existence of a natural genetic discontinuity between prokaryotic
species:
- [Jain et al, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07641-9):
  High throughput ANI analysis of 90K prokaryotic genomes reveals clear species boundaries.
- [Murray et al, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24128-2):
  Re-evaluating the evidence for a universal genetic boundary among microbial species.
- [Rodriguez-R et al, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24129-1):
  Reply to: “Re-evaluating the evidence for a universal genetic boundary among microbial species”

In this paper, we provide a detailed point-by-point response to the concerns
raised by Murray and collaborators.
